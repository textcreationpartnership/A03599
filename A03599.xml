            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now it is right, and the failing in any of theſe two breakes it; if a man ſay, I know and doe not Will it, that is folly: If a man ſay, I will, and have no reaſon for it, it is obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and not a ſound Reſolution. And ſo when the Vnderſtanding is informed, and the Will is not ſetled on it, it is only Conſultation; but the Will ſaith, I will not have it thus: A man may be good in Conſultation, but not in Reſolution: when the Drunkard is convinced, it is an evill to be drunke; and ſo the Vſurer, but yet will be ſo ſtill, and with the Addar turne the deafe eare, and will continue in it ſtill, and the Adulterer is convinced of his ſin, when he goes in to the Adultereſſe, hee ſhall never returne, here the Vnderſtanding is cleare, but the Will comes not off, and ſo he will have his ſinne ſtill: ſo when the Perſecutor is convinced, that perſecuting Gods Saints is a ſinne, and hates it, this is cleare to the Vnderſtanding, yet the Will will be malicious ſtill: the heavieſt part is the Will. As in a Parliament. Conſultation, they muſt propound all to the King, and he muſt ratifie, and confirme it; now when the Will ſaith, I will not ratifie that, I will not leave that ſinne, nor take up that duty, now all this while it is not ratified, till the Will come off. Away with theſe pieced and patched Reſolutions and purpoſes, as to ſay, it were good, it were ſo, and I would all would doe ſo, and I could afford to bee ſo, but all the world would perſecute mee: this is a <hi>Halfe-Reſolution</hi>;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4392:18"/>
away with theſe patched Reſolutions, to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations at every turne, it is nothing elſe but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and diſſimulation: ſay therefore; Is not the ſanctification of the Sabbath day, better then the prophanation of it? ſay <hi>Heart,</hi> is not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a Chriſtian courſe better then with the Harlot to wipe the mouth, and ſay all is well? and all truth, though the leaſt) that God reveales, is it not better then all the world? if it be, <hi>Will,</hi> doe thou cloſe with it, and ſay within your ſelves, here are reaſons cleare, let heaven and earth meet together, though al the duſt on the earth, and ſands on the ſhore, and ſpires of graſſe in the fields were Devils, I will have that which the word reveales, though I die for it. This is a happy heart; when the ſoule ſees, the greateſt good is holineſſe, and reſolves to have it, this is a ſound Reſolution.</p>

            <p n="1">1. We muſt know there are ſome inward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in God that the creature cannot imitate the like. No creature can create, or be Infinite, or the like, and it is blaſphemy to thinke it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There be other qualities that <hi>God</hi> doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to leave an impreſſion of in the creature, and the creature is ſaid to imitate God therein, be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as God is holy; and bee mercifull as God is mercifull; but the Scripture doth not ſay, imitate God in Infiniteneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.48. 2 Pet. 1.4.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. a man muſt be partaker of the divine nature of <hi>God</hi>; the Lord is holy, and patient, bee thou ſo too.

               </label> When a man placeth a kinde of ſupremacy or excellency in himſelfe, or any thing hee doth or hath beſides <hi>Chriſt</hi>; wherein ſoever we place ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency or excellency beſides in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is ſelfe. This is that which troubles all people, world and ſelfe doe every thing, and nothing well.</p>
            <p>There are foure ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A mans life, for that is the beſt thing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is <hi>Naturall Selfe</hi>; A man naturally makes life the chiefeſt good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

It is covetous, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſo farre as I am over-powred vvith it. For the Adulterer that ſeekes to obey his luſts muſt needs ſeeke to obey himſelfe, becauſe hee is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of his luſt. So pride is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſelfe, ſelfe prayes, preacheth, profeſſeth; all ſelfe, that is ſinne, and corruption, <hi>Iude</hi> 18.<note place="margin">Iude 18.</note> who walked after their luſts, their owne ſelfe-lying, and ſelfe-ſvvearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18.<note place="margin">Rom. 16.18.</note> they ſerve their owne belly, their baſe gluttony was their ſelfe, they ſerved it. So every ruling ſinne is a corrupt ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Abilities of gifts or learning which GOD gives, I call it <hi>Morall,</hi> or <hi>Civill ſelfe.</hi> Common graces are ſelfe to a civill man, becauſe he counts them the beſt things hee hath, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.5.</note> wee preach not Our ſelves, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>; ſo a man may preach ſelfe, when he preacheth learning it is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſelfe.

So an hypocrite will pray with others, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, this is ſelfe-praying.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A man may make even his graces and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall abilities ſelfe, when a man prankes up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and expects ſomething from grace, this is a gracious ſelfe. He makes grace a God, he reſts on that, not on <hi>Chriſt</hi>; the heart claps it ſelfe on the backe by this, and ſaith I can doe ſo and ſo, and expect to be ſaved, the having of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is not ſelfe, but when the ſoule ſets a ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

and excellency in theſe; when a man will doe any thing for life, luſts, parts, gifts, graces, and makes as it were Idols of them, and worſhip them. Now all theſe muſt be denyed; and caſt ſuch a man into the Sea, he will ſhift for himſelfe well enough I warrant you.</p>

            <p>Firſt, ſinne is the ſupreame ruler in every carnall heart: hence it is ſaid to give lawes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12.19.20.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.19.20.</note>

            <p>Secondly, the evill that comes by this ſelfe-ſeeking, all the ordinances of God, as the Word, Prayer, Sacraments, you and they are accurſed ſo farre as you ſeeke your ſelfe by them: they that preach for themſelves, God curſeth them and their preaching too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that heares for Selfe, his hearing is accurſed, for Selfe is the Maſter and commands thee, as a ſhip that is never ſo well furniſhed with tacklings, if it runne upon a rock, it ſplits; ſo though thou be never ſo frequent in all ſorts of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if thy aime be naught, and you ſplit upon the rocke of Selfe, all is accurſed. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.23,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.23.</note>

            <p>This evill that comes by ſelfe-ſeeking, appeares in three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God entertaines no ſuch ſacrifice: why? it is that which is diſhonourable unto God, and can he accept it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.5.<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.5.</note> a company of hypocrites ſought their pleaſure, now ſaith God, canſt thou call this a faſt? Is this ſuch a day as I have choſen? no, I accept no ſuch ſervice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God aſſiſts not, hee rewards not any ſuch ſervice: why ſhould God doe the worke, and we take the praiſe? <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.3.<note place="margin">Mat. 6 3.</note>

            <p>Firſt, it is the way to have our ſelves, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in us (not ſinfull) our ſafety, comfort, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, credit, it doth not remove theſe, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rectifie them; it is a groundleſſe ſuſpition of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hearts, they thinke if they lay all at ſtake, they muſt take their leave of all, profit and comfort and all. No, denying of a mans ſelfe, doth not take all theſe away, but maintaines them. The onely way for a ſubject to be preſerved, is to yeeld homage to his Prince, but if a man prove traitor to the Crowne, he ſhall be hanged for a traitor; ſo life, ſufficiency, ſafety, are good ſubjects ſo farre as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4392:46"/>
they ſerve God, but if they take the wall of Gods will, and will be rulers, you may be hanged as traitors, whereas otherwiſe you might have beene honoured as ſubjects, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Hee that loſeth his life, ſhall ſave it</hi>: the loſing of a mans life is the next way to ſave it: it doth not take away pleaſure: rejoyce evermore, though not in drunkenneſſe: it proves a greater good then if we had ſerved Selfe: the denying of Selfe is the improving of Selfe, and the renouncing of ſinne is the next way to get pardon of it: if we lay downe our wit, behold a greater wiſedome to direct us: empty your ſelves of frothy vanities, and you ſhall be wholly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the glory of Chriſt, who would not then change for a better? Come out of Selfe, and you ſhall have a Saviour, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.18.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.17.</note> 
               <hi>Come out of her my people, and I will dwell in you:</hi> come out of your owne power, and the Lord will beſtow ſtrength; lay downe God-ſelfe, and the great God will cheere you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.29.<note place="margin">Mat. 19.29.</note> they forſook their fathers, and their nets, and marke what Chriſt addes, <hi>whoſoever forſakes father or mother, wives or children, or lands for my ſake, and the Goſpels, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an hundred fold</hi>; that is, you have taken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in a carnall courſe, lay downe thoſe, and you ſhall have a hundred fold more, deny that ſelfe-looſeneſſe, and you ſhall have joy unſpeakeable and glorious; if you have left riches, you ſhall have unſearchable riches in Chriſt, and what can you have more?</p>
            <p>Secondly, againe, if wee can deny our ſelves, God will not deny us, the time will come, we ſhall be aſhamed of ſelfe-ſafety, when the time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4392:46"/>
approacheth, or when the day of death comes, and you are going the way of all fleſh: where then is the glory and beauty of all that you expected? what now is become of your wit and policie that you doted upon? then all thoſe parts and gifts, all that pride add ſtoutneſſe, all will faile you, miſerable comforters that they are: now the carnall wretch will ſay I prized life before Chriſt, now I muſt part from it; here now is all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort I can finde in theſe, I may goe to hell. It is juſt, God ſhould deny us, if we deny him. God may ſay, goe to thoſe Gods whom you have honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: goe now to your Cups and Queanes, and let them pacifie your conſciences: thus it is juſt God ſhould deny us, becauſe we have denyed him, but if we deny our ſelves, God will not deny us.</p>

               </label> There is a twofold condition in affliction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If a man be not called to it, it is a duty to avoid it; rather to ſhun the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>are then to be caught by it: and this ſtands upon three commands at the leaſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When a man is called to affliction, and God hath put him into the battell, that trouble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery come, then to fling away the Croſſe is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing; the unbeleeving and fearfull are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, and ſhall be coupled together in hell. It is that which God ſuffers not; you know that place, That he that denies me before men, that turnes his back in the day of battell, and ſtarts off when afflictions come, he that denies the Lord now, and will beare nothing for him, the God of heaven will deny him; he that playes faſt and looſe with Chriſt, and now he will be a Diſciple, and now he will not; when he cryes for mercy, God will ſay, No, no; you would not know me, therefore depart, I know you not: he that denies God in trouble, God will deny him introuble.</p>

               </label> 1. When God ſtops all means, when there is no way to avoid it, then God calls to fight, and that even to the laſt man. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16.<note place="margin">Dan. 3.16.</note> The three Children when they could not avoid it, ſtood it out ſtoutly; we are not carefull to anſwer thee in this, O King. But <hi>Elias,</hi> the ſtouteſt man that earth bare, when he was threatned by <hi>Iezebel,</hi> and had a way to eſcape, he flew from <hi>Iezebel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.<note place="margin">1 Kings 19.</note> If the three Children had had the like liberty to flie that <hi>Elias</hi> had, they would and might have fled; but becauſe there was no way to prevent it, they ſtoutly bore it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:4392:53"/>2. But if the Lord doe give liberty, and ſet out a way that it is poſſible to avoid perſecution, yet if by withdrawing, either diſhonour will come to the truth, or if by it a man ſhall omit a duty on which the ſalvation of many ſoules depends, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a man ſhould flie off from the truth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taught by him, and ſo diſcourage others, let him die, and feale the truth with his blood, and rather die then diſhonour the truth, and omit duty, and hurt others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then, if the truth ſhall ſuffer hazard by our ſhrinking aſide, it is a ſinne. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.16.</note> At his firſt anſwer all forſooke him, they put him in the forefront, and left him there, they went one to this, and another to that; I love <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith one, but my ſhop muſt be ſerved; I love <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the truth is, I muſt looke to my lands; Did theſe doe well in it. No, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I pray God it be not laid to their charge. Thus we ſee, if the truth ſhall ſuffer any hazard by our flying, though we can eſcape, yet in this caſe we ought not to flie troubles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If duty be omitted; If a man be in place or office of authority, and forſakes duty becauſe of perſecution, he ſinnes fearfully.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning the ſalvation of others; If a Miniſter hazard the good of his Congregation by flying, woe to him. Obſerve this rule, and it will goe a great way; all afflictions that lie betwixt me and duty, undergoe them, though hell gates were open: It is not neceſſary, a man ſhould want a Croſſe, it is neceſſary a man ſhould want ſinne; rather die therefore then be wanting in ſervice.

There is a generation that would bee chriſtians, but they would have no Croſſe: they chriſtians? we have a name that wee are alive, but we are dead; if a man ſhould tell you, you are none of Chriſts, you would think it very ill: whereas your conſcience tells you, you are not able to beare the breath of the wicked in ſcornes and ſcoffes, how then will you beare the weight of

            <p n="1">1 An hypocrite is content to beare much, but when you fret him to the heart-veyne, he is dead; he that beares through pride, will beare any thing but contempt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13.<note place="margin">Luke 8.13.</note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. yet hath he not root in himſelfe, but dureth for a while, for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4392:56"/>
when perſecution or tribulation ariſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the word, he is offended; there is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of temptation, and ſeaſon of ſorrow: a proud mans hold is credit, take away credit and honour, and he is gone, but all comes alike to a Saint.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It may be poſſible, that a good man may bee over-borne with troubles, and an hypocrite may be thus: but a ſound chriſtian when hee recovers himſelfe, that he hath gotten his fence, hee takes ſhame, and is couragious afterward; but a carnall hypocrite, what he hath done, he will defend, but he conſiders not arguments that may make him to take up his Croſſe, he takes a brow of braſſe, and out-faceth all; and will beare any thing that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but they that joyn with him are loved, and his arguments are commended: <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſtand on tearmes, but he remembred the words of Chriſt, and wept.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Both may dye in the maintenance of the truth, and yet both may differ, for a ſound chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an labours to credit the Goſpell in dying, he takes up the Croſſe of Chriſt, for Chriſts glory; but a carnall hypocrite hath his baſe aymes and ends. A man may dye through pride, as a Ruffian, rather then he will beare the lye, he will fight it out, hee doth not maintaine his life, but his baſe luſt. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts will come over and play the traytors, that they may be canonized for Saints: a man may dye without love, but a gracious heart ſuffers for the love of the Goſpell.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4392:58"/>

               <hi>In the world ye ſhall have trouble, but in me ye ſhall have peace:</hi> thou art in priſon, but in Chriſt inlarged, here weake, but in Chriſt made ſtrong.

               </label> Here we will give you the arguments. Obſerve you the cauſes of forſaking the Croſſe of Chriſt, which are two:</p>

            <p n="2">2 The weakeneſſe that is in us, that we are not able to beare it. Now ſelfe-denyall removes both theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That ſelfe-denyall takes away the keenneſſe and ſharpeneſſe, and the argument is this. If ſelfe-denyall keepe the Croſſe from pinching, then it is a ſpeciall meanes to take away the ſharpeneſſe, and ſo to make us beare it; the firſt is cleere, therefore the ſecond muſt follow. Then that it may appeare that ſelfe-denyall takes away the ſharpeneſſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Croſſe doth not take away any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing: trouble and perſecution doth not take away faith; fa man were in a dungeon, he might be faithfull; the fire doth not conſume the metall, but take away the droſſe; ſo outward things are onely conſumed, the other are not touched; now then ſince the ſharpeneſſe lyes in outward things, ſelfe-denyall beats backe the blow, ſo that it cannot trouble him: the onely way to take away the fire, is to take away the fuell; ſo when the fire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is flaming, ſelfe-denyall takes away the fuell, on which affliction ſhould burne. Now it doth this thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A ſelfe-denying heart doth baſely eſteeme of theſe baſe things: ſo much as you prize a thing, ſo much you are grieved for the loſſe of it; a woman that marvellouſly eſteemes her childe, when ſhee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4392:60"/>
loſeth her childe, ſhe loſeth her life: if men would eſteeme jewels as pebbles, the Ieweller would be no more grieved for the loſſe of them then for pebbles; ſo he that eſteemeth his honour, (as the ambitious) his life, as the naturall man, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his life are his Gods; take away his God, and he ſinkes; but a ſelfe-denying heart placeth no worth in theſe; if riches be gone, there is but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow gone; if life be gone, there is but a bubble broken, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24.<note place="margin">Acts 20.24.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> counted not his life dear, as who ſhould ſay, if he had counted his life dear, he had not finiſhed his courſe with joy. A rich man cares not to loſe ſixe pence, ſo ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I count not my life deare: all men forſook <hi>Paul,</hi> ſave onely the houſe of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> yet this troubled not <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he had this ſelfe-denyall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It looſens a mans affections from delighting in any thing here below, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26.<note place="margin">Luke 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>26.</note> a ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying heart hates wife and children ſo farre as they hinder him from Chriſt: he that looſens this knot, may eaſily untye it: love a thing immoderately, and be grieved for the loſſe of it exceſſively; a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſpeech caſt upon a proud perſon, how diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged is he at it? but a ſelfe-denying heart cares no more for it, then for the barking of a dog: what can priſon take from him? he hath given his liberty to Chriſt before; he that caſts the duſt on the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, cares not though the winde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ngs dung, and therefore he is not troubled, if he loſe all to gaine Chriſt. It is with a ſelfe-denying heart as with a dead man, he feeles nothing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> 
               <hi>He is crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world, and the world to him</hi>: if you will take
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4392:60"/>
away glory, and lay ſhame upon him, he feeles it not; he is dead to the world; if you diſgrace him, he cares not; you touch not him; it is eaſie for a man to looſe that he hath not; now a ſelfe-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, that hath honour, is as if he had no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; if you take away his joy, he is not troubled; he is as if he had it not, he hath loſt nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he left all before in affections.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It takes away that boiſterous diſpoſition whereby he oppoſeth the Providence of God, that brings the Croſſe. We by pride oppoſe the providence of God, bringing the Croſſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are troubled with it: now ſelfe-deniall takes away this; therefore all the trouble is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Firſt, the bird beats her ſelfe, therefore ſhe is troubled with the Cage; the colt is untamed, therefore troubled with fetters; when he is tamed, he may live well with the fetters: ſo as that which makes affliction tedious is our wayward heart, till God have weaned us; then a dungeon is as good as a houſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſelf-deniall takes away that weakneſſe that is in us to beare the Croſſe; &amp; that two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It makes way for deriving of ſpirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; this made the Martyrs ſo conſtant, that the Maſſacrers cryed out, they were weary with kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; it came not from fleſh and blood, but from ſelfe-deniall; he that is conſtant to deny his owne ſtrength, the ſtrength of the Lord ſhall ſupply him; the Lord is able to ſupport him: now a ſelfe-denying heart makes way for this ſtrength, he is nothing in himſelfe; therefore Chriſt is all in al in him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do al things in Chriſt who
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4392:61"/>
ſtrengthens me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note> There is a vertue given from Chriſt to a ſelfe-denying heart to beare trouble.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It brings refreſhing from Chriſt. Two things there are in common reaſon to beare a burden.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Strength.</item>
               <item>2. Cheerfulneſſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>So ſelfe-deniall gives ſtrength and ſweetneſſe; we may eaſily ſwallow theſe pills, becauſe they are ſugered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Contend for the faith. Contention implyes oppoſition, the more trouble, the more courage God requires. Sound ſaving grace will never ſlip away, in the greateſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then is the time for love to doe moſt: a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) is borne for adverſity: love is like lightning, it is moſt fiery where it findes moſt oppoſition: ſo when love is in moſt oppoſition, it is moſt violent in reſolution, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20.<note place="margin">Acts 4.20.</note> 
               <hi>We cannot but ſpeake the things we have heard,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, we haue a warrant from God, therefore we cannot but doe it, and in the ſecond verſe, the lame man being cured, the Scribes and Phariſes were grieved at it, the Diſciples having taught concerning Chriſt, and the glory that came to the Goſpell:

the Scribes and Phariſes thought to cruſh the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, now ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> verſe 9. <hi>if we be examined concerning the good deed</hi>; as who ſhould ſay, you Scribes and Phariſees uſe to convent people for good deeds. Therefore be it knowne unto all you men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, you Phariſes would have Chriſt hidden, therefore all ye men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be it knowne, that by the name of that Ieſus whom ye have crucified, this man ſtandeth whole; thus zealous was he, though convented: the ſpirit of the Lord is a kingly ſpirit, therefore it will make a man leap over all blocks, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16.<note place="margin">Ruth 1.16.</note>

            <p n="3">3 Afflictions are ſo farre from hindring, that they further obedience, there is no thanke to the Croſſe for it: in it ſelfe it is a kinde of poiſon, but this Croſſe that would hinder a man, the power of Chriſt over-powring it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> helps a man, and that in two particulars.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Grounds of this formall righteouſneſſe, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how a man comes to ſet up his reſt in ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull an appearance.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is the divels policy, when he cannot draw men to a falſe worſhip of God, to ſet up Idols, then he laboureth mainly to detaine men in the ſhell and ſhadow of an outward worſhip, to make them quiet themſelves in this as all that God requires. Thus were the old Iewes exceedingly beguiled, while they placed all religion in outward ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; by this men are kept from the life and power of godlineſſe, while they are ſo farre ſeduced by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:4392:84"/>
Sathan, as to reſt in the Paradiſe of a formall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Man by nature is devoted beyond meaſure to his naturall corruption, ſo as what hee wils, that he wils with his whole ſtrength; ſo loath are men to part with their corrupt practiſes, that skinne for skinne, and all that a man hath, will he give rather then forgoe any part of that which he is by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall apprehenſion bent unto. Hence the Scripture tearmes the ſinnes that a man is more ſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto, his right eye, his right hand, then which, what is not a man more willing to loſe? hereupon the heart of man ſeekes, and having by ſeeking found ſuch a righteouſneſſe, as wherein it may be ſomething with God, and yet retaine his owne ſelfe-liking ſinnes, by all meanes embraceth this forme of ſervice of God, takes great con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This formall ſervice of God will bring whole rivers of outward ſervice, even the firſt borne of his body, for the ſinne of his ſoule, ſo be it he may retaine his owne will.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The honourable and glorious things that the Lord hath ſpoken of outward ſervices; the Lord aſcribes the greateſt worke to the Miniſtery of the Word and Sacraments, the opening of the eyes to the blinde, the working of faith, the cleanſing of the heart, the ſalvation of body and ſoule; ſo to

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 Deceits. Firſt, that for thoſe outward duties performed, they endure perſecution, undergoe many mockes and taunts from wicked men, come into trouble for that they doe, being well done; and from hence they gather confidence, that their courſes are approved of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is no ſure argument of the truth of a mans profeſſion, that he endures trouble for it. No queſtion but <hi>Iudas</hi> had his part in thoſe croſſes that did accompany the preaching of the Goſpel, and yet who doubts of the rottenneſſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? but among others, <hi>Alexander,</hi> of whom we reade, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. chapter, 33. verſe,<note place="margin">Acts 19.33.</note> that hee was neere unto death for the Goſpels ſake, and yet of the ſame man (as <hi>Calvin</hi> thinkes) doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> give a heavy cenſure, when hee prayes that God would reward him according to his workes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the worlds hatred of a Chriſtian profeſſion is not directly againſt it, as it is ſound and ſincere, joyned with truth in the inward parts;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:4392:85"/>
it lookes onely upon that which ſheweth it ſelfe in religious performances, that is the object of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mens malice, they pry not into the truth of grace in the heart; but if a man doe joyne himſelfe with the people of God in the holy exerciſes of religion, that is it which provokes their malice. In matters of enmity betwixt differing parties, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to endure the ill will of the one, but in ſhew and appearance to joyne with the other; and ſo it is no ſure and infallible marke of a friend of God, for a man to ſay that he hath ſuffered in the cauſe of religion: the very outward face of religion, ſets the divell and wicked men on worke.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there may be great deceit in ſuffering, wherein a man can have no comfort, as if it were an inſeparable companion of ſincerity: men may ſeeke themſelves, their glory, honour, and have worldly reſpects in yeelding their neckes to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the Goſpels ſake. If any man (ſaith our Saviour) will be my Diſciple, hee muſt deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and take up his croſſe and follow me, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24.<note place="margin">Math. 16.24.</note> Wee muſt looke that our ſuffering have a denyall of our ſelves and our owne affections, elſe they ſhall nothing availe us. A mans affliction for religious duties performed, is then onely an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth of grace, when a man being toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them, lives onely by faith in Gods word, and is not fed with the hope of glory, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſuccour and reliefe from man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Deceit. That many good men applaud them in their courſes, yea godly and faithfull Miniſters commend them, encourage them; now would they honour an imperfect profeſſion of religion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:4392:85"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No doubt but it may and ought to be a good comfort to us, that we have the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſuch as feare God in thoſe waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we walke: but notwithſtanding it is a ſure rule, that of another mans eſtate before God, no man can judge with a judgement of certainty; for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one man judgeth of another onely by fruits of the ſpirit, what outward worke of the ſpirit of grace is there, which the pride of mens hearts, and the divell together, cannot counterfeit? they will make a ſemblance of faith, of repentance: other men though good, yet miſtake us even when they doe their beſt, it being beyond their reach to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of another mans eſtate. The uprightneſſe of any mans heart in the duties he performes, it is poſſible onely to God and himſelfe to know, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.3.<note place="margin">Pro. 17.3.</note> 
               <hi>The fining pot is for ſilver, and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tryeth the hearts of men, and no man knoweth the heart of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man that is in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we reaſon deceitfully, if from mens approbation of our courſes wherein we walke, we conclude an allowance of our eſtate, that all is well with us, becauſe ſomething is deemed to bee upright. It is all one as if a diſhoneſt perſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming an honeſt action, and receiving juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for the ſame, ſhould thence gather a generall reſolution for his honeſty. Good men approve us in our hearing the word, prayer, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, but good men will not approve us as every way good, becauſe good in theſe: beſides, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we performe in attending on ordinances, may be good in their nature, and yet wee may marre

them in the manner of performing them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we muſt know that good and godly Miniſters in this prophane and wretched age, are glad to apprehend and cheriſh the leaſt bloſſoms of goodneſſe that doe ſhew themſelves; are ready to encourage men in any good courſes, by giving them their deſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters deale with Profeſſors, as the ſervants of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi> did with the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> glad when they can catch but as a good word, heare but of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of a good exerciſe. Our Saviour hearing the yong man making ſuch a profeſſion of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, though it was onely in regard of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, yet it is ſaid, hee looked upon him and loved him: and ſo in like manner, why ſhould it not be lawfull for us to love and like a man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; to teſtifie our liking of thoſe in whom wee perceive any good beginnings, in pious and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes? and yet this is no warrant for ſuch to reſt in thoſe outward formes of religion, as if all were perfect in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Deceit. That there ſeemes to be an agreement betwixt them and the moſt forward profeſſors, they joyne in the ſame parts of Gods worſhip with like diligence; frequent Gods ordinances; why may we not from thence conceive all to be well with them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That whatſoever a childe of God wil doe by vertue of ſincerity in his heart, that ſame will an hypocrite doe out of the pride and vanity of his heart: the webbe of hypocriſie is moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſpun, ſcarcely to be diſcerned but by him that hath the ſpirit of diſcerning more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.

Compare the reformation of <hi>Iehu,</hi> with that of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and you ſhall ſee little difference; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends as great zeale, is as ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, we have examples of ſome in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who have witneſſed an univerſall agreement in their profeſſion, even unto the parting from their lands and poſſeſſions, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reaſoning, to conclude a totall agreement from a partiall, an inward from an outward. Let all Chriſtians bee exhorted and perſwaded, that they beware how they build upon this ſame ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming formall righteouſneſſe, that they doe not bleſſe themſelves in it as a ſtate of al-ſufficiency to ſalvation: as if greene leaves could make good trees, or formall profeſſion good Chriſtians; it will deceive them that truſt it in their greateſt needs: and for the better enforcing this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it may more lively pierce the hearts of all formall profeſſors, conſider theſe motives.</p>

to ſee to, in regard of the large and plentifull crop, though he have no part in it; even ſuch may be the joy of the temporary, cauſed not from any perſwaſion of propriety and intereſt in the things, but only from the glorious hiew and beauty of the things themſelves: But as for the elect of God, their joy ariſeth from an evidence of that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they have of their intereſt in them, that they are peculiar to them, and that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the promiſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The joy of the temporary is a joy that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from a ſlight taſte that he hath of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and the Chriſtian prerogatives; whereas the joy of the true converts ſprings from that good they finde even from a perfect nouriſhment that they receive, finding themſelves juſtified and ſanctified by vertue of that they have gotten in the miniſtry of the word. The Apoſtle in the words laſt ſpoken of the temporary profeſſour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. gives occaſion of this difference, for even as it is one manner of joy that a man conceives upon the taſting of good meate, when the ſame notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is never perfectly digeſted and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good bloud; another when a man ſo joyes in that he taſtes, as it is converted into perfect nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment; ſuch is the difference betwixt the joy of the temporary and the perſevering profeſſour.</p>

            <p n="4">4 The joy of the elect in the word, is a joy that ſprings up by certaine ſteps, ariſing from the ſence of miſery, feeling of Gods anger, hungring after grace; for the heart of man humbled with this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wretchedneſſe, abaſed and caſt downe in the ſenſe of his miſery and wants, flies unto the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of the word, where finding gracious promiſes, and the loving nature of God deſcribed at large, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth it ſelfe; and out of the ſweetneſſe of Gods promiſes apprehended by faith, curing the wounds of our diſtreſſed ſoules, doth greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the ſame; the word becomes ſweeter then the honey and the honey combe; but the joy of the temporary is ſudden, as a flaſh of lightning, and therefore deciphered by the ſprouting up of the ſeede in the ſtony ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The joy of the temporary is of a vaniſhing nature, it ſoone fades; as the corne that growes out of the ſtony ground withereth forthwith for want of earth, ſo is it with the temporaries joy, it is as the crackling of thornes under a pot, ſoon in, ſoon out: hereupon his delight is compared to him that

comming into a pleaſant garden, is delighted while he is within the ſmell: but the elects joy is more permanent, continued longer, he hath a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of thoſe ſweet flowers, wherewith hee refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe, even when hee is gone out of the Garden.</p>
            <p>Deceit 2. He pleaſeth himſelfe in this, that hee hath ſome inward compunction of heart for his ſinnes, that hee is pricked in conſcience, troubled for ſinne, feeles a horrour in his ſoule; thence hee conceives his eſtate to bee as the eſtate of Gods children, ſince he is in this like them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If theſe gripes of conſcience were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible notes of one that is in the ſtate of grace, then might <hi>Eſaus</hi> weeping, <hi>Ahabs</hi> humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Iudas</hi> his ſorrowing, plead an intereſt in this eſtate, whom notwithſtanding the Scripture hath marked with the blacke coale of reprobation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is a worldly ſorrow, as well as a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both have ſinne for their object, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.</note> and yet the one cauſeth death eternall. This ſorrow for ſinne cannot give any man comfort touching the welfare of his eſtate further then hee is aſſured it is a godly ſorrow, whereof more ſhall bee ſaid hereafter. The devils have a horrour in their ſouls, wherewith they tremble at the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; are afrighted with legall terrours, yet never a whit the neerer the ſtate of grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The ſorrow of thoſe men doth not lye long upon them, it is not of a laſting nature; but like a vapour that now appeares, and anon vaniſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Many are Sermon-ſicke, as thoſe that are ſea-ſicke, exceeding ill at eaſe, queaſie ſtomacks,

while they are on the Sea; yet the ſame men when they come on land, are as wel as ever they were ſo we have many who in the hearing of the word, ſeeme to bee much troubled, exceedingly caſt downe; yet the ſame men when comming abroad, they are but acquainted with the ayre of the world, their pangs of ſorrow paſſe away: ſuch was the ſorrow of <hi>Felix,</hi> who while he heard <hi>Paul</hi> diſputing of righteouſneſſe and temperance, and of judgement to come, he trembled, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25.<note place="margin">Acts 24 25.</note> yet no ſooner was <hi>Paul</hi> departed, but his covetous heart prevailed over him: whereas the nature of the ſorrow which may give a man comfort touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eſtate, as that whereby he is advanced into the glorious condition of Gods children, is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding ſorrow, goes to bed, and riſeth with us, as <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.3.<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.3.</note>

            <p>Deceit 3, He hath good motions, holy deſires and inclinations, whereby he reſolves for the beſt waies, and what doe the moſt righteous more?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That good purpoſes, unleſſe they bee brought into practiſe, they are as untimely birth; no good comes to them in whom they are: for even as that infant which is onely conceived and never borne, is counted as if he had never beene, ſo is it with theſe abortive and miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purpoſes. It is the very glory and perfection of theſe good motions when they are beautified with an actuall performance of that which was purpoſed, otherwiſe our hearts deale with us in good purpoſes, as <hi>Zarah</hi> when he was to be born; make a faire ſhew, as if they would come out of ſinne, and yet give backe, all is nought worth: our deſires in this kinde are no other then a man may finde in hell mouth. What benefit was it to thoſe Iewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.34.<note place="margin">Iohn 6.34.</note> that they cryed out, <hi>Lord ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more give us that bread,</hi> when notwithſtanding they did not uſe the meanes to compaſſe it, as appeares, verſe 36. what good had <hi>Agrippa</hi> by being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded almoſt to become a Chriſtian? or was <hi>Balaam</hi> ever the neerer to heaven, for that hee deſired to dye the death of the righteous? why then doth the temporary carry himſelfe ſo ſtiffely upon his good purpoſes and deſires?</p>
            <p n="2">2 If wee take an account of thoſe deſires, by comparing them with thoſe that are found in men truely converted, wee ſhall finde many notorious differences. Thoſe deſires of the temporary are
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4392:92"/>
like them of the ſluggard, who luſteth, but his ſoul hath nought, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.4.<note place="margin">Pro. 13.4.</note> they are lazie, faint, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence offered to the corruption of our nature; but thoſe of the converted are painefull, laborious, joyned with a moſt earneſt uſing of the meanes; thoſe in whom they are all called violent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12.<note place="margin">Mat. 11.12. Phil. 3. Mat. 5.6.</note> yea, they are ſaid to preſſe forward, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. to hunger after righteouſneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. yea, ſecondly, theſe of the temporary feele no griefe for the want of that they deſire: but thoſe of true converts are joyned with an inward moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate mourning towards him whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; their ſoule faints, they are ſicke after that they deſire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.7.<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.1. Pſal. 143.7.</note> 
               <hi>Heare me ſpeedily O Lord, my ſpirit faileth, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, thoſe of the temporary (as all beginnings of grace) are fickle, vaniſh away, come to nothing; theſe other are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, hold out, give no reſt to their eye-lids, till they have gained ſomething wherein they may reſt.</p>
            <p>Deceit 4. That hee findes himſelfe more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then many of thoſe that have beene ancient profeſſors; is more hot and earneſt in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good duties, even then they of whoſe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no man had ever cauſe to doubt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the ſtony ground (by which one kinde of the temporary is to be underſtood) is marvellous forward in ſending forth the blade; as it lyes not deepe, but in the face of the earth, ſo it ſprouts and ſhewes it ſelfe more ſpeedily, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. So it is marvellous to behold ſome of theſe temporary profeſſors, how ſoone they are ripe, how violently forward; but according to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4392:93"/>
thoſe violent beginnings, they doe as ſoone fade and wither away. It is with them as with men that are over-forward in the morning at their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in the afternoone conſtrained to give over: it is an ill ſigne of perſeverance in good duties, when a man is forward and zealous beyond the age of his chriſtianity; and looke as wee muſt not lay any great hope upon children that are witty and forward beyond their age, ſo likewiſe wee ſhould not thinke any whit the better of our ſelves, by reaſon of our ſudden over forwardneſſe. Our Saviour ſpeakes of ſome who were laſt, who ſhall be firſt, and firſt that ſhall be laſt: why may not the hot and over-earneſt temporary ſuſpect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for one of theſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2 We muſt in our forwardneſſe conſider wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether nature hath not a hand in it as well as grace, or beyond it. For I doubt not but when ſome ſeeds of religion fall into the heart of a yong man, or a man of a ſtirring ſpirit, they doe receive a great impreſſion of heat from the naturall warmth that is in him; he purſues things that be contrary to him with greater intenſion, not of zeale alone, but of zeale ſet on fire by the ſtrength of nature. It ſhall be wiſedome therefore for men to examine and try their zeale and their forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Peter</hi> being a man of a fiery and ſudden ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by nature. Religion was many times prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſet on worke by nature, and he made a ſhew of more forwardneſſe, and yet I doubt not but as much, if not more ſubſtance of zeale was in the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He may miſtake ancient profeſſors, when he ſhal
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4392:93"/>
meaſure the ſubſtance of inward grace, by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blaze of forwardnes. In many this forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes out-runs judgment, wiſdom, holy diſcretion, and accordingly makes a great ſhew in the eyes of the beholders. In others ſoundneſſe of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wiſdome, experience have over maſtered affections, ſo as they are no whit leſſe zealous, but more wiſe, diſcreet, better ordered; manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their practiſes with no whit abatement of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, but with much more comfort to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and good to others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Deceit, That he findes the Lord rewarding him for that which he doth; ſees ſome of Gods temporall promiſes made good unto him, both in mercies communicated, and judgments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this might give any aſſurance of the ſoundneſſe of grace in the heart, then might <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> put in for a part among the ſonnes of God, of whom it is recorded that the Lord regarded his temporall and but ſeeming humiliation (for it was not with his whole heart) with a tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the judgment that ſhould have beene infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, from his dayes to the ſucceeding generation. So likewiſe <hi>Iehu</hi> went not unrewarded for that which he did in deſtroying the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi>;<note place="margin">2 King. 10.30.</note> his children were <hi>to ſit upon the throne of Iſrael to the fourth generation.</hi> Yea further, ſuch hath been Gods juſtice, that he would not have heathen men doe any thing that he had appointed to be done without a reward. Wicked <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Ezek.</hi> 29.20.<note place="margin">Ezek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29.20.</note> ſhall have the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> given him for his labour wherewith he ſerved againſt it,

becauſe they wrought for me ſaith the Lord, and ſome of the ancient fathers have imputed the long continuance of the Roman Empire as a reward in Gods juſtice given to the practiſe of civill ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, wherein many of them were famouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The temporary might in his well doing more comfort himſelfe, as an argument of ſaving grace in him, if God did not reward him in this life; he might looke then for a reward at the generall Iudgment, where God gives the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of eternall life; but that God rewards him here in this life, the Lord ſignifies that he will not be indebted to him; now he hath all that he muſt looke for.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, what is the leaſt meaſure of ſaving faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is a conſtant earneſt deſire of the pardon of ſin flowing from an humble heart, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a conſcionable uſe of the meanes, I ſay, conſtant, to difference this deſire from the moody paſſions that are in naturall men, to whom God diſcloſing the fearefulneſſe of the vengeance to come, they doe for the inſtant deſire a remove all of their ſinnes. I ſay earneſt, with reſpect to the

Laſt of all, this deſire expreſſeth it ſelfe in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent uſe of the meanes, whereby it may be increaſed, as Prayer, hearing the word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacraments.

            <p>Thirdly, where ever the ſpirit of <hi>God</hi> is work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaving grace in the heart, there muſt needs be faith; but where ever ſuch a deſire ſo qualified is, there muſt needs be the ſpirit of God; for theſe

deſires not being the fruits of the fleſh, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily come from the ſpirit. And doubtleſſe they are ſent as an earneſt penny and pledge of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life: yea, looke as a deſire to live cannot come from a dead man, no more can the deſire of the life of grace in us proceed from us, as we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men dead in ſinne. Thus wee ſee what is the leaſt meaſure of ſaving faith; leſſe then which if we have, we are not beleevers, and conſequently, not in the ſtate of grace.</p>

equall eye to be had to all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſince they all lay a bond upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and the majeſty of the Commander ſhines as well in the one as in another. Now that a man may the better examine his obedience, I will propound a five-fold difference of Gods Commandements, by which the heart of man is apt to deceive it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Commandements are firſt, either ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the outward man, as keeping the Sabbath, juſt and righteous dealing amongſt men; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as confidence in God, cleanſing of the heart from evill thoughts. Now new obedience muſt equally reſpect both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20.</note> Glorifie God in your bodies, and in your ſoules.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they are either the greater Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, or ſuch as are of leſſe importance, as the ſpeaking of a vaine word, idle mirth; Chriſtian o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience muſt have an eye as well to the one as to the other, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. <hi>theſe ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Commandements are differenced ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the two Tables: ſome concerning du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers reſpecting duties to men. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly who ever would have comfort in his obedience, muſt obey God in both; not ſtrict in the one, looſe in the other, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.7.8.<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.7.8 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and 14. duties of the firſt and ſecond Table are both enjoyned, not onely to keepe Gods Sabbath, humble thy ſelfe with faſting; but alſo the practiſe of mercy and juſtice among men.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Commandements of God are either ſuch as concerne our generall calling, as we
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4392:111"/>
are Chriſtians, whereby we call upon God, heare his word, ſeeke the good of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>; or our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall calling (<hi>i.</hi>) that eſtate and condition of life wherein we are placed to ſerve God in ſerving of men, as to be a Magiſtrate, or Miniſter, a Maſter of a family, or ſervant. Now wee muſt obey God not onely in the duties of our generall calling, but alſo of our particular; that is, a profeſſour muſt not onely be a hearer of Gods word, a receiver of the Sacraments, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, commandements of God either reſpect the common ſinnes of mans nature, or the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall infirmities whereunto either by the temper of their bodies, place where they live, or perſons with whom they live, men are more ſubject, then to others. This difference I ground, as alſo the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of our obedience to God in it, on the 18. Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.23.</note> where the Prophet profeſſeth, verſe 23. <hi>I was upright alſo with him, and have kept mee from my wickedneſſe.</hi> To conclude then, as wee deſire to have comfort in our obedience, as a teſtimony that we are in the ſtate of grace, wee muſt be carefull, that wee caſt an equall reſpect to the whole revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of God.</p>
            <p>Third marke. That new obedience, where it flowes from the ſeede of grace in the heart, is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with perſeverance, continuance, holding out in the good wayes we walke in: ſo that howſoever there be through our weakeneſſe and Sathans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, actuall infirmities, yet there is alwaies an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall

Now we ſhall make tryall of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of it. 1 If we doe not loſe our hold even when wee are provoked by many occaſions and temptations unto evill, then to forbeare, and cleave cloſe to the Lord, is an argument of the truth of our obedience, in regard of continuance. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be chaſte where wee have no allurements to unchaſtity; nothing to be meeke, when no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to diſtemper us, nothing to be good among good, ſo are men that are ſtarke naught: but to be good among evill, to be meeke in the midſt of wrongs and injuries; to be chaſt among unchaſt provocations, that is the true meanes of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Out of temptation, ſinne forbeares us, not we it; and a Chriſtian is no more for obedience, then he is in the day of temptation: if then he faint, it is becauſe his ſtrength is ſmall, or nothing at all. <hi>Noahs</hi> renowne was, that he was righteous in that wicked age. <hi>Lots</hi> commendation, that hee was chaſte in <hi>Sodome; Ioſephs</hi> chaſtity for ever appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

It was the glory of the obedience of thoſe Chriſtians, that they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe many afflictions, loſſe of goods, content to be made a gazing ſtocke, and yet in all they clave cloſe to their profeſſion, knowing that they had in heaven a better, and an enduring ſubſtance, ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.8.</note>

            <p>Thirdly, the conſtancy of our obedience is knowne, if, when all outward helpes and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances are taken away, we keepe our integrity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in good duties. Many men make a faire ſhew while they are propped up with ſome good helpers, who afterwards fall away, as if they had never beene the men.

That this obedience is of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying and growing nature; it doth not ſtand at a ſtay, but ſtrives and gets ſtrength: it is ſtill preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forward in conſultation daily how it may prevaile againſt his owne corruptions, encreaſe in holineſſe: for this growth the Apoſtle prayes, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9.<note place="margin">Col. 1.9. 2 Theſ. 1.3.4.</note> that they might increaſe in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of God, ſo 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3, 4.

            <p>Marke 1. To love a good man as hee is good, and beares the image of God, is ſuch a part and branch of new obedience, as whereby a man may be aſſured, that the Lord hath marked him out to eternall life: for naturally wee hate all goodneſſe, as that which is a ſecret condemner

               <hi>Every one that loveth him that begate, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi> Now leſt our hearts deceive us, wee muſt be wiſe to try, whether wee love good men for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is in them, or for ſome carnall reſpects; as either for that there is an agreement and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude betwixt our naturall inclinations, or for ſome civill qualities, naturall dexterities that wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in them, as pleaſing to us, or for their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to us, or for their outward greatneſſe in the world. Obſerve therefore thy ſelfe, whether thou love goodneſſe, where it is ſtripped of all theſe fleſhly reſpects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider whether thy love be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or increaſed, according as thou ſeeſt the worke of grace, to receive either abatement or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>

               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:4392:115"/>Thirdly, In reſpect of our owne ſelfe love; which blindes our judgements; this would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that the leaſt appearance of grace is grace it ſelfe, that every outward performa nce of a good duty is the fulfilling of the law; as in the young man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20.<note place="margin">Matth. 19.20.</note> ſeeing therefore we are expoſed to ſo many wayes of ſeducements, ſo eaſily ſurprized by an errour in our wills, wee muſt be the more diligent in the tryall.</p>

Why are we not as wiſe for our ſoules? that ſeeing our whole eſtate of future happines depends upon the truth of grace wrought in this life in our hearts, we be carefull to ſift, and examine our ſelves?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Conſider that in our naturall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (which in all things in this life will not truſt to any thing but what we have tryed) a man uſually will not uſe a weapon to fight withall, but
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:4392:116"/>
he will try it, not willingly take a piece of mony, but try it; not entertaine a ſervant, but try him; nothing almoſt that we deale withall, but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire tryall; and yet how is it, that we can reſt in a faith, a repentance, and never try them? examine them according to thoſe rules that the Scripture hath given in that kinde, ſhall we be ſo ſcrupulous in the gew-gawes of this life, and for the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly graces of the ſpirit not make the ſame inquiry?</p>

            <p>This point will more fully appeare, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ground and end of our Adoption.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ground of it, which is our union to Chriſt the naturall Sonne of God. We are alive, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to God in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Rom.</hi> 6.11.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.11. Rom. 11.23. 1 Cor. 12.27.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider we the end of our Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we might have a right and intereſt unto our heavenly inheritance.</p>
            <p>The end of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Incarnation is our adoption; and the end of our Adoption is our right and title to that inheritance without the which wee could not have had it, that therefore which is called Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note>

But our Adoption advanceth us to an higher eſtate which <hi>Adam</hi> never had, nor (for ought we know) had never promiſed him before his fall.</p>
            <p>We paſſe now to the ſecond point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That none are the children of God by Adoption; but ſuch as are ſo by Regeneration.</p>
            <p>There are (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) three ſorts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p>Secondly, There are ſome that are ſonnes in regard of God, but not in regard of us; nor may ſo bee in regard of their owne eſteeme neither; and ſo are all the elect as yet uncalled and unga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, as the Evangeliſt ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.52.<note place="margin">Iohn 11 52.</note> they are for all that (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes) in their fathers role, and predeſtinated to be adopted through <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> unto himſelfe, according to the purpoſe of his will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6.<note place="margin">Eph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This point alſo will appeare more evidently, if we conſider, as before the ground and end of our Regeneration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ground of our Regeneration (as before of our Adoption) is our union with <hi>Chriſt</hi> our head, and this is wrought by faith on our part, and by the ſpirit on Gods part.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by the ſpirit on Gods part, he that is joyned unto the Lord is one ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> 
               <hi>By which ſpirit it he knits and faſtens us to Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 2.20.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
               <hi>I live, as the ſoule in the body; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the fleſh, I live by faith in the ſonne of God.</hi> And marke what the Apoſtle ſaith excellently to this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10, 11.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.10, 11.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that confirmes the point is the end of our Regeneration.

            <p n="1">1. A producing of a new creature. Now it is a rule in Philoſophy, that the generation of one is the corruption of another. So in the ſpirituall birth, the old man muſt be put off, before the new be put on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.1.</note>

               <hi>You hath hee quickned which were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, Ezek.</hi> 36.26. A new heart will I give unto you, and there will be an alteration and change in a man when hee is once regenerated; a new joy, new love, new feare, new deſires; and the Sabbaths of God, which formerly were weariſome and burthenſome unto him, are now delightſome; and ſo of the reſt. In a word, he will love what before he loathed, and loath what before he loved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Breeding is a producing of an entire body; children have at the firſt not a rude maſſe, but an organicall body, all the parts and lineaments of a man. So it is in this ſpirituall breeding likewiſe; put on the new man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> when men therefore ſhall ſeeme to be renued in ſome part alone, and not in the reſt, they are not regenerate, they are not borne again, if they deny themſelves in ſome luſt, and not in others, ſo long as they live in any not controverſed, but confeſſed ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Breeding muſt be the producing of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after the image of the party producing; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living creature begets his like; a ſheepe brings not forth a wolfe, nor a Pigeon hatch a Kite.
